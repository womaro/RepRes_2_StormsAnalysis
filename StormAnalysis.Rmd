```

## Abstract

This analysis focused on data collected in US between 1950 and 2011 and managed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
